# Foodable Server
This repository is the Node.js Backend for Foodable.
It's pretty simple, it delivers static content pages that use Bootstrap 4 to style them, no frontend frameworks otherwise.
To build this, you'll need MySQL, as well as a `.env` file with your MySQL and email credentials (which are used to notify you when a new organization registers).
This repository isn't really meant to be hosted by anyone besides the one running on my domain, I have it here for the purposes of showing the backing code.
If you'd like to host your own Foodable server, by all means go ahead though.

You can look at the client frontend (much more interesting) at my other repo for it, [foodable](https://github.com/LucasBaizer/foodable).
